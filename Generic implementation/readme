The file format for the generic implementation consists of four lines which contain -- the x-coords, y-coords, final intensities and the time of the changed points (in-between successive frames)
x-coords and y-coords for the original video have been standardized down to 800x800 matrix
Final intensities are the final grayscale intensities ranging from 0 to 255
Time for changed points has the time (in milliseconds) from the initial frame ;
