...in the hands of a man
who'd kill a child.

1388
01:59:06,223 --> 01:59:10,559
That's a very tender notion, but
the man is on death row for the crime.

1390
01:59:13,939 --> 01:59:16,023
...he's huge.

1391
01:59:16,191 --> 01:59:20,861
If he tried to get away, it'd take
a lot of bullets to stop him.
