Xournal 0.4.8 -- Win32 binary distribution (unstable)
-----------------------------------------------------

Xournal is written by Denis Auroux and other contributors.
More information can be found at http://xournal.sourceforge.net
Installation instructions: see below.

This is a binary distribution of Xournal 0.4.8 for the Win32
platform, including all necessary libraries, compiled using
the MinGW system. 

Special thanks to Dirk Gerrits for detailed instructions on
how to compile Xournal for Win32.

Please note this Win32 port is still unstable. Some features 
do not work properly. Stability and data integrity have not been
checked carefully (use at your own risk); and there is no installer.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:
--------------------------

* STEP 1 - INSTALL XOURNAL

Unzip the entire distribution into a directory of your choice, and
create a shortcut to xournal.exe on your desktop.

(Note that conflicts may arise if you already have other versions
of the relevant libraries installed in your Windows directory).

* STEP 2 - DISABLE WINDOWS FEATURES THAT INTERFERE WITH PEN INPUT

Disable all the pen stroke/gesture detection features of your version
of Windows that interfere with proper pen input in xournal. 
In Windows 8, open the Control Panel, go to "Pen and Touch", and 
disable the "Flicks" feature entirely.

To avoid blurry display and/or Wacom tablet calibration issues with
multiple monitors, consider disabling the display scaling features
of Windows 7 and 8 if you have a high pixel density display:
right-click on the xournal.exe shortcut, go to Properties -> 
Compatibility -> check "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings".
(Or disable display scaling system-wide: open the Control Panel, go to
Display, and set the "make text and other items smaller" feature to the
"smaller" or "100%" setting.)

* STEP 3 - INSTALL THE WACOM TABLET DRIVER

If you have a Wacom tablet (or Tablet PC using a Wacom digitizer),
you are strongly encouraged to install the Wacom tablet driver,
available at http://us.wacom.com/en/feeldriver/ for Tablet PCs
(http://us.wacom.com/en/support/drivers/ for standalone tablets).
This will make stroke smoothing and pressure sensitivity available.
If your tablet pen has an eraser tip, you should enable the "Eraser tip"
option in the Options menu.

This should work under all recent versions of Windows (XP or later);
however on many systems, it is necessary to use the pen to start xournal
for these features to be available in xournal, or at least tap the pen to
the screen before starting xournal. (Check that Options -> Use XInput is 
available and checked; if it is grayed out the wacom driver is not active).

* STEP 4 - OTHER LANGUAGES

If you would like to use a language other than English (among the
limited number of available translations), arrange for the LANG
environment variable to be set to the appropriate two-letter code.
(For instance, set LANG=fr)

Note that there may be issues with accessing files located in folders
whose path contains non-English characters (accents etc.); if you
encounter difficulties, move the files to a different folder before 
editing them.

* KNOWN ISSUES

There are various known issues; the worst ones relate to text items, 
fonts and printing. 

- If xournal seems to hang the first time you create a text item, just
be patient: the fontconfig library on which xournal maintains a cache 
of system fonts, and on Windows the creation of the cache can take 
several minutes. Once the cache is created, things should run smoothly.

- Some fonts may not print well or export to PDF well. If you have
trouble with File -> Print, try Export to PDF instead; and vice-versa.
If neither works well, try using different fonts.

- Copy-paste: when copy-pasting items from other windows applications
to xournal, sometimes xournal receives an old item rather than the 
one most recently copied into the clipboard.
